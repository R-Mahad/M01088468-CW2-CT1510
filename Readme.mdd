Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform (Week 11)

Module
CT1510 – Programming for Data Science / Intelligent Systems

Week:
Week 11 – Object-Oriented Refactoring & Visualisation

Project Overview
This project is a multi-domain intelligence platform built using Streamlit and SQLite.

It allows users to analyse and manage data across three domains:

Cybersecurity
Data Science
IT Operations

The application was originally developed using a procedural approach in earlier weeks.
For Week 11, the project was refactored to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) while keeping the original functionality intact.

Week 11 Refactoring Summary
The main aim of Week 11 was to improve the structure and maintainability of the codebase.

Refactoring changes made:

Introduced model classes to represent real-world entities:
SecurityIncident
Dataset
ITTicket
Converted database rows into Python objects

Used object methods to calculate metrics (e.g. high risk incidents, active tickets)

Kept existing database access functions (app.data.*) unchanged

Improved separation of concerns between:

Data access
Business logic
User interface

The refactoring improves code clarity without rewriting the entire application.
